# Fake-news-detection-demo
This is the first and simple version of a Fake news detection try.
This version needs to be improved, some notes with this version are:
1- The input data is imbalanced, because of that I used Recall as the metric of the model.
2- It seems we do not have overfitting.
3- Improvement is possible using fine-tuning
4- The target labels need to be calculated automatically, due to scalability.
