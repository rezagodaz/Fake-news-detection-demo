The fine-tuned version uploaded, this is an incomplete version, just for presentation. The original model was also uploaded. I changed the original model for saving the weights.

The first version of Fake news detection is working (it is corrected) but with low accuracy.
This version needs to be improved, some notes with this version are:
1- The input data is imbalanced, because of that I used Recall as the metric of the model.
2- It seems we do not have overfitting.
3- Improvement is possible using fine-tuning
4- The target labels need to be calculated automatically, due to scalability.
